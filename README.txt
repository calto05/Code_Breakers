Running the project:

If the project does not run through the github link then you need to download the files and click on the index.html
filt to run the project. Chrome and Opera did not work with p5js so I needed to make some fixes. If the application
does not run in either of those browsers it runs originally in firefox so that may work.

How to play:

1.	Begin by clicking a card to increase its value by one. If the value is 9 then it cycles back to one and continues.

2.	Once you are satisfied with your guess click guess to receive hints for your current guess. Please note that after 
	doing this you can no longer change that guess.

3.	After clicking guess if a number turns blue it means that the number in that position in the code you are trying to 
	guess matched exactly your guess.

4.	After clicking guess if a number turns red it means that the number in that position in the code you are trying to 
	guess it one greater or one less than your guess.
	
5.	After clicking guess if a number remains black it means that the number in that position in the code is not within one or exactly your guess.

6.	After all 5 guesses or whenever you feel as if you know the answer click the commit button to stop guessing (you 
	cannot guess after this). When committed 3 cardâ€™s will appear with a prompt to enter your final answer. After you 
	click submit its game over!
